    "bio": "I have experiences mostly in pop concert culture. I have organized and worked for several festivals all over the country, organized and managed numerous concerts, worked for large event organizing companies, did booking management and brand management for an A-listed hungarian band, and earlier I have been working on city branding as well. I learnt how to manage a project, how to delegate tasks and lead a team well, how to negotiate hard and also how to be accurate at administration and contracting. Now, I'm ready to learn more, and seek new challenges.",
